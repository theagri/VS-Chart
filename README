    *   Defaults should look great

    *   DWIW

    *   Extendable implementation

DESCRIPTION
    This module produces charts from data. Such charts might be line, pie
    and boxes. Currently only linecharts are implemented. The renderer uses
    Cairo Graphics (<http://www.cairographics/>) which is a graphics library
    for creating vector graphics to produce crips and correct output.
    Currently, we limit output support to PNG, PDF and SVG altho Cairo may
    support more.

INTERFACE
  CLASS METHODS
    new ( %ATTRIBUTES, [ no_defaults => 1 ] )
        Creates a new chart definition and sets any attributes passed in
        *%ATTRIBUTES*. If *no_defaults* is specified the chart will not be
        populated with default values when rendered.

    supported_types
        Returns a list of supported renderers.

  INSTANCE METHODS
    set ( %ATTRIBUTES )
        Sets a number of attributes.

    get ( ATTRIBUTE )
        Get the value of an attribute.

    has ( ATTRIBUTE )
        Check if an attribute exists.

    add ( @ROW )
        Adds the data in *@ROW* to the chart. If the first element is a
        *Date::Simple* object the first column will be marked as the index
        column provider and sorted accordingly when rendered.

    render ( type => TYPE, to => PATH, [ as => FORMAT ] )
        Renders the chart using the renderer specified by *TYPE* and saves
        the output as *PATH*. By default the *FORMAT* is png but pdf or svg
        may be used instead.
